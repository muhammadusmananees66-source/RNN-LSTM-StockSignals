# RNN-LSTM-StockSignals
A deep learning project that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict stock prices and generate trading signals. The model leverages historical stock data to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, providing a robust approach for time-series forecasting.
